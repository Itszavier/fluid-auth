## Lessons Learned

Creating this package has been a tremendous learning journey. Honestly, I started with very little knowledge about authentication, but through the process of building this package, I have learned a great deal. I've gained insights into implementing OAuth2, understanding security vulnerabilities, and applying best practices to address them.
